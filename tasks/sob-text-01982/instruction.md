      "content": "Context:\nPuppydog Tales: Rosie & Ruff in \"Puppydog Tales\" is a British children's television cartoon created by Hilary Hayton, creator of \"Crystal Tipps and Alistair\".  The show was narrated and scripted by Victoria Wood.  The series was originally broadcast on the BBC in 1992 only running for 13 episodes but was repeated through till 1996.\n\nRyde or Die Vol. 1: Ryde or Die Vol.  1 is a compilation album from American hip-hop record label Ruff Ryders Entertainment, released on April 27, 1999.\n\nHeichū Monogatari: Tales of Heichū (Heichū monogatari) belongs to the genre of uta monogatari poem tales that emerged in Japanese literature from the mid 10th to the early 11th centuries.  As early as the \"Collection of Ten-Thousand Leaves\" (\"Manyōshū\"), a poetry collection completed around 759, there appeared poems introduced by brief prose narrations.  The imperial court began to come alive with poetry from around this time.  People exchanged poetry with one another on topics as diverse as love and politics and religion.  Towards the end of the 9th century it was common for individual poets to keep compilations of their own verse, sometimes explaining in prose the circumstances behind a poem's composition.  The highest honor was to have ones poem selected for inclusion in the \"Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry\" (Kokinshū), the first imperial poetry collection, which was completed around 905.  By the middle of the 10th century the idea of a poem paired with a prose narration seems to have taken hold, and \"Tales of Ise\" (Ise monogatari), \"Tales of Heichū\", and \"Tales of Yamato\" (Yamato monogatari) seem to have emerged at about this same time.  Also, the second imperial poetry collection, \"Collection of Later Poetry\" (Gosenshū), commissioned in 951 and compiled shortly thereafter, has many narrative qualities.  The only extant manuscript of \"Tales of Heichū\" is a 61-page codex discovered in 1931 that seems to date from the Kamakura Period (1185–1333), some three hundred years after the work's probable date of composition.\n\nFaerie Tale Theatre: Faerie Tale Theatre (also known as Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre) is an American award-winning live-action children's anthology television series, starring many famous and well known actors (particularly of the period) including Robin Williams, consisting of 27 episodes retelling 25 classic fairy tales, particularly of The Brothers Grimm, plus the poem The Pied Piper of Hamelin and a special episode called \"The Grimm's Party\", showcasing the series cast and crew, (including Duvall and Teri Garr), that originally aired on Showtime from September 11, 1982 until November 14, 1987.  Shelley Duvall, who created the series served as narrator, host and executive producer of the program alongside Fred Fuchs, and occasionally starred in episodes.  The series was followed by two other, albeit less successful shorter anthology series \"Tall Tales & Legends\" (episode 9) which followed the same format as \"Faerie Tale Theatre\" and focused on classic American folk tales and third series Nightmare Classics (4 episodes, originally planned as 6).  This was one of the first examples of cable original programming, alongside HBO's \"Fraggle Rock\".\n\nVictoria Wood: Victoria Wood (19 May 1953 – 20 April 2016) was an English comedian, actress, singer and songwriter, screenwriter and director.  Wood wrote and starred in sketches, plays, musicals, films and sitcoms, and her live comedy act was interspersed with her own compositions, which she performed on piano.  Much of her humour was grounded in everyday life and included references to quintessentially \"British\" activities, attitudes and products.  She was noted for her skills in observing culture and in satirising social classes.\n\nJigga My Nigga: \"Jigga My Nigga\" is a single by Jay-Z from the Ruff Ryders Entertainment compilation \"Ryde or Die Vol.  1\".
